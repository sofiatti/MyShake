# Future Work
- Re-do trainig and validation with smaller windows of data. Check minimum window for high accuracy.
- Do classification for every 4s, check how early we can detect an earthquake.
- R-do training with some information about how much more often 'noise' files exist than 'earthquake' file, instead of assuming they are equally likely events
